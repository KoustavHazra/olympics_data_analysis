This project is based upon a historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. Total 120 years of data is available here.

Now the data is divided into two parts, summer olympics and winter olympics. I've done this project particularly on summer olympics.

## Features:
Total of 4 different analysis I've done on this project: Medal Tally, Overall Analysis, Country-wise Analysis, Athlete-wise Analysis. If you go in each section, you can customize the dashboards and check whatever you want.
